    "Due to changes in Keras and Tensorflow, the code provided in this lab may break with the most recent versions of Tensorflow or Keras. In such event, replace all \"keras\" with \"tensorflow.keras\". E.g. change \"from keras.layers import Dense\" to \"from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will achieve the following objectives in this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. An understanding of the practical limitations of using dense networks in complex tasks\n",
    "    2. Hands-on experience in building a deep learning neural network to solve a relatively complex task.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As this lab is more challenging than the previous labs, please work in teams of two persons. Please use the respective categories in the LumiNUS Forum under the \"Labs\" Heading to find a partner within your own group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step may take a long time to run. You and your partner may want to work out how to do things simultaneously, but please do not miss out on any learning opportunities.\n",

    "## 2. Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Please work together as a team of 2 to complete this lab. You will need to submit ONE copy of this notebook per team, but please fill in the names of both team members above. This lab is worth 55 marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DO NOT SUBMIT MORE THAN ONE COPY OF THIS LAB!**\n",

    "### 2.1 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit this completed Jupyter Notebook (cs3237lab2.ipynb) to the Files -> Labs -> Lab Submissions -> Lab2 Submissions-> Group Bxx folder by 1.00 PM on the following dates:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Group B1: Friday 10 September, 1 pm.\n",
    " 2. Group B2: Monday 13 September, 1 pm.\n",
    " 3. Group B3: Sunday 12 September, 1 pm.\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2.2 LATE SUBMISSION POLICY\n",
    "\n",
    "If you submit between 1 pm and 1.15 pm, a 5 mark penalty will be levied. Submission is strictly not allowed once the folder closes, and you will receive 0 for the lab. NO EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will now begin building a neural network for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 50,000 32x32x3 (32x32 pixels, RGB channels) training images and 10,000 testing images (also 32x32x3), divided into the following 10 categories:\n",
